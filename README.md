# ML project Predicting Total Wave Output of a Wave Energy Farm

---

## **Introduction**
Wave energy is a rapidly advancing and promising renewable energy source that holds great potential for addressing the challenges of global warming and climate change. However, optimizing energy output in large wave farms presents a complex problem due to the expensive calculations required to account for hydrodynamic interactions between wave energy converters (WECs).This project employs data preprocessing, feature engineering and regularization to create a model that generalizes well to unseen data.


## **Dataset**
This [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/882/large-scale+wave+energy+farm) was gotten from UCI repository and was derived from a study published at the GECCO conference. It includes 54,000 and 9,600 configurations involving 49 and 100 WECs, coordination, power, q-factor, and total farm power output.
